You are building a Valentine-themed Pac-Man game for a personal website. Add the game to games.html.

The game should include the following features:
Classic Pac-Man maze with dots/pellets, ghosts chasing Pac-Man, and game-over when all lives are lost.
Valentine power-up: a rose 🌹 appears randomly from time to time. When eaten, Pac-Man enters powered-up state for a few seconds and continuously shoots hearts 💕 in his facing direction for a limited time.
Hearts travela across the maze and remove any ghosts they hit. Power-up expires after a few seconds.
Keep game playable directly in-browser with HTML, CSS, and JS (can use canvas or DOM grid).
Include score, lives, and start/restart buttons.
Style with Valentine theme colors, hearts, and rose animations.
The game should be recognizable as Pac-Man with the above features.
